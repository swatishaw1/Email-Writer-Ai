1. <Typography>
Typography is a Material-UI component used for text rendering.
It automatically applies Material Design typography styles (font size, weight, line height, margins, etc.).
You can set its variant (heading, body text, caption, etc.) and HTML element (component) separately.

2. variant='h3'
This tells MUI to use the H3 style from the theme (large, bold text).
Variants in MUI include: h1, h2, h3, body1, body2, subtitle1, caption, etc.
This affects styling, not the HTML element.

3. component="h1"
This changes the actual HTML tag rendered in the DOM.
In this case, the text will be wrapped in an <h1> element but will have H3 styling.
This is useful for SEO and accessibility — for example, you might want <h1> in the HTML for page hierarchy but keep it styled smaller.

4. gutterBottom
This is a shorthand prop in MUI that adds extra bottom margin to the text.
It helps create spacing between headings and the content below.

sx={{ py: 4 }} in Container
sx is MUI’s inline styling prop.
py = padding on the Y-axis (top + bottom).
The number 4 here refers to MUI’s spacing scale:
1 = 8px → so 4 = 32px.
